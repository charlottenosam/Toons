Toons
=====

Informative scatter plots: why plot points, when you can draw cartoons?

A "toon" is a representation of a model object, drawn in context. For example, galaxy catalogs typically contain a number of parameters such as RA, Dec, color, magnitude, size, and so on, and astronomers make lots of scatter plots in two of these model parameter dimensions at a time. Plotting each galaxy as a "galtoon" allows more dimensions of the model parameter space to be explored.

The user is able to input galaxy catalog data pertaining to halos, disks and bulges, and Toons will plot a superposition of "blobs" that represent the component properties.
