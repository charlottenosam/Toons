#### Why plot points, when you can draw cartoons?

A "Toon" is a representation of a model object, drawn in context. For example, galaxy catalogs typically contain a number of parameters such as RA, Dec, color, magnitude, size, and so on, and astronomers make lots of scatter plots in two of these model parameter dimensions at a time. Plotting each galaxy as a "GalToon" allows more dimensions of the model parameter space to be explored.

You can input galaxy catalog data pertaining to halos, disks and bulges, and the Toons will plot themselves as a superposition of "blobs" that represent the component properties. Blobs can have position, size, ellipse axis ratio, orientation, colour and brightness, with values chosen by you.

### Examples
* [Bulgeless disks](http://github.com/cmason90/Toons/tree/master/examples/bulgelessdisks) - Bulgeless AGN host galaxies from Galaxy Zoo, color vs stellar mass.
* [The Odyssey](http://github.com/cmason90/Toons/tree/master/examples/theodyssey) - galaxies in a square field around "The Odyssey" Milky Way analog galaxy, from the [SAGA survey](http://github.com/saga-survey). See also the example image above.

### Still To Do
* Nice halo representations in GalToons
* AGN as point sources in GalToons
* StarToons, PlaneToons, etc, all using the same blobs as GalToons.
